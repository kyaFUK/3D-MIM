# Memory In Memory Networks

3D-MIM is a neural network for predicting the evolution of SN simulations. It is based on the paper [3D-Spatiotemporal Forecasting the Expansion of Supernova Shells Using Deep Learning toward High-Resolution Galaxy Simulations
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00026).

## Abstract

Natural spatiotemporal processes can be highly non-stationary in many ways, e.g. the low-level non-stationarity such as spatial correlations or temporal dependencies of local pixel values; and the high-level non-stationarity such as the accumulation, deformation or dissipation of radar echoes in precipitation forecasting.

We try to stationalize and approximate the non-stationary processes by modeling the differential signals with the MIM recurrent blocks. By stacking multiple MIM blocks, we could potentially handle higher-order non-stationarity. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on three spatiotemporal prediction tasks across both synthetic and real-world data.

## Pre-trained Models and Datasets

All pre-trained MIM models have been uploaded to [DROPBOX](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7kd82ijezk4lkmp/mim-lib.zip?dl=0) and [BAIDU YUN](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1O07H7l1NTWmAkx3UCDVMLA) (password: srhv).

It also includes our pre-processed training/testing data for Moving MNIST, Color-Changing Moving MNIST, and TaxiBJ. 

For Human3.6M, you may  download it using data/human36m.sh.
